## 1. Local Democratic Party

In Washington state, the Democratic party is organized at both the county and legislative district level.  
For example: if you live in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle, 
you would want to get involved with both the King County Democrats and the 43rd Legislative District (LD) Democrats.
Or if you live in East Wenatchee you would want to get involved in both the Douglas County Democrats and the 12th LD Democrats.

Use this tool to find your legislative district: [http://app.leg.wa.gov/districtfinder/](http://app.leg.wa.gov/districtfinder/)
